As an IOT/Computer Visions Intern at the Graduate Rotational Internship program (GRIP) by The Sparks Foundation (TSF), the second task is to **implement a color detector** which **identifies all the colors in an image/video.**

For more learning purposes, I've utilized this feature in **segmenting unlabeled territory maps by color and recognizing each part**.

Using the K-means unsurpvised approach to create clusters from common colors and identify them.

Open-cv for Image Processing

Numpy for arithmetic operations on arrays in order to aggregate results.
