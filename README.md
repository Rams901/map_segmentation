As an IOT/Computer Visions Intern at the Graduate Rotational Internship program (GRIP) by The Sparks Foundation (TSF), the second task is to **implement a color detector** which **identifies all the colors in an image/video.**

For more learning purposes, I've utilized this feature in **segmenting unlabeled territory maps by color and recognizing each part**.
